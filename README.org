* Student Management System
** Brief Introduction
Student Management System(SMS) is project that i created in order to learn golang. This 
project handles all the CRUD  HTTP requests( PUT, GET, DELETE, POST). In this project, there are following 
systems:
    + Sign in and Sign Up (written in python )
    + Token Based Authentication (Firebase Authentication)
    + Handling HTTP requests
*** Technology used:    
    + gin (web framework for go lang)
    + firebase (User Authentication)
    + POSTGRES (database for storing the student records)
    + Docker (containerization)

** Run Project 
    Requirements:
        #+begin_src
            - Docker installed in the system
            - Python version 3.18
        #+end_src

    1. Clone the project
    2. Running the project:
        - for first time
        #+begin_src
            make build
        #+end_src
    3. Stopping the project:
        #+begin_src
            make stop
        #+end_src
    4. Removing the project from the system:
        #+begin_src
            make stop
            make remove
        #+end_src
    5. Restarting the project after stoping:
        #+begin_src
            make run
        #+end_src

** For Testing:
    1. Run the  generate_token.py file in the auth_token directory to add new users and log in,
    from which you can get token which is useful for authentication.
        #+begin_src
            python3.8 -m venv venv # create python virtual environment
            pip install -r requirements.txt # install all the requirements
            python3.8 auth_token/generate_token.py # run the file
        #+end_src
    2. Copy the token after login and add it it in the header while sending requests
        #+begin_src
            Authorization: Bearer Token_after_login
        #+end_src
